/*
 * ================ Framework Configuration ================
 *
 * Controls framework compilation behavior and feature flags.
 *
 * WHAT'S IN THIS FILE:
 * - Boolean flags that enable/disable major framework features
 * - Theme selection for primary/fallback theme
 * - Build-time compilation options
 *
 * WHAT'S NOT HERE:
 * - Design values (colors, spacing, typography) → _tokens.scss
 * - Utility class generation → _utilities.scss
 * - Component styling defaults → _base.scss
 *
 * USAGE:
 * These settings determine what gets compiled into your final CSS.
 * Disabling features reduces bundle size but removes functionality.
